<h1>The Best Movies According to Fadila</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies of All Time</h2>
<hr/>

<h3>The Notebook</h3>
<p>One of my all time favourite romance movies that depicts the toxicity and love partners have for one another. It describes how partners can love yet still not be good for each other, but still be there for each other for as long as time is still in their favour.</p>

<h3>Spirited Away</h3>
<p>My favourite anime movie which show all the plots and twists one movie has. </p>

<h3>The Perks of Being a Wallflower</h3>
<p>My favourite comfort movie that isn't really extraordinary, but is still in my top 3 whenever I want to experience what high school feels like again.</p>
